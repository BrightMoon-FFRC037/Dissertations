# Introduction
I learnt Ideal Gas Law in hight school for the first time when I was familiar with the P-V diagram, P-T diagram and V-T diagram. 
$$
PV = nRT = NkT
$$
However, considering the nature of Ideal Gas Law which consists of three variables, the two dimensional planar figure can not represent it exactly definitely.

When it comes to drawing 3D figures, matplotlib is a good choice. [Here I present an example](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/689957174).
