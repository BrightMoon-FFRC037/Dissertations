# General Mechanism
## input: reception of signal
### extracellular signal molecule
* secreted signal
* contact
* gap junction
### receptor protein
* cell surface receptor proteins
    * ion channel coupled
      * acetylcholine
    * GPCR: G protein coupled receptor
      * GPCR - G protein - ion channel/enzymes
      * photon
      * histamine
    * enzyme coupled receptor
      * RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase)
      * JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase - Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription)
      * TGFβ SMAD
* intracellular receptors
    * nuclear receptor
    * for steroid hormone
      * thyroid
      * cortisol
## process: transduction of signal
### intracellular receptor proteins
* switches based on phosphorylation
    * inactivated by phosphatase
    * activated by kinase
* switched based on GTP/GDP
    * inactivate by GAPs (GTPase activating protein)
    * activated by GEFs (Guanine nucleotide exchange factor)
* second messenger (diffusive)
    * cAMP
    * Ca2+
    * DAG: diacylglycerol
    * IP3: inositol triphosphate
* signaling complex
    * scaffold based
    * receptor based
    * phosphoinositide based
## output: cellular response
* effector proteins
* GPCR-G protein-enzyme
  * adenylyl cyclase
    * cAMP-PKA (protein kinase A)
  * PLC: phospholipase C 
    * IP3: inositol triphosphate-Ca2+-PKC
    * DAG: diacylglycerol-PKC (protein kinase C)
* GPCR-G protein-ion channel
  * K+ channels
