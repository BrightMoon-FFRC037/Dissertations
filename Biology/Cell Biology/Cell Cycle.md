      * mitosis
        * pro-: whether spindle starts to assemble
        * prometa-: whether chromosome is attached to spindle; nuclear envelope disassembled
        * meta

      * cytokinesis
# Critical Steps
* duplicate
  * replication fork
* partition
  * condensin: condense the chromatid to be the chromosome
  * cohesin: tie the sister chromatid together
  * mitotic spindle
    * for mitosis
    * by microtubule and motor protein (kinesin (+) and dynein(-))
    * attached to kinetochore
  * anaphase promoting complex (APC)
    * destroy securin
    * trigger proteolysis of cohesin
  * contractile ring
    * for cytokinesis
    * by actin filament and myosin
* coordinate
  * mitogen
  * cyclin
  * cyclin dependent protein kinase (CDK)
  * cyclin-CDK complex
    * Cdc25 helps to activate the complex
    * Wee1 dose in the reverse way; so dose p21
  * anaphase promoting complex (APC)
    * degrade cyclin
# Details
## G1 to S
* promote
  * mitogen
  * RTK
  * Ras
  * MAP kinase
  * relieve inhibitor: Rb protein
  * produce cyclin and Cdk
* halt
  * DNA damage
  * keep p53 (protein) from degradation
  * produce p21 (Cdk inhibitor)
  * inactivate cyclin-Cdk complex
## Preceding in S Phase
* Cdc
* Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)
* helicase
