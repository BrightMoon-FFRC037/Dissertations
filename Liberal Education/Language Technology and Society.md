# *Social Media* and Language Play
* features of Computer Mediated Communication
  * multidimensional continuum 
  * code switching   
  * neologism
    * old word with new meaning: bookmark
    * compound: homepage
    * conversion:unfriend/friend
* language play, especially bracketed annotation
  * cooperative principle
  * politeness principle
  * violating or flouting a maxim
# Netspeak and Lucid Self Construction
* mask are connected to:
  * change
  * step out of the everyday life
  * be someone else
  * avoid taking responsibility for one's action
* dual interactivity (macro) of online interaction (micro)
  * change what is represented online
  * in a social context, respond to others
  * computer games as an example versus narratives
# *Machine Translation* Literacy and *Machine Translation* Ethics
* proliferation of literacy
* machine translation literacy and ethics
  * how MT works
  * change MT face
    * ambiguity
      * anaphora
      * co-reference
      * metaphor
    * bias
      * pre-existing
        * disfavor the generation of feminine form (vs masculine form and neuter form)
      * technical
      * emergent
    * transparency
    * privacy or confidentiality
    * tips
      * proper punctuation
      * relevant context and additional info
  * whether, when, where, and how MT can be used
  * a cognitive issue, rather than a technical issue
# *Machine Translation*
* empiricism
  * corpora
  * data driven
* rationalism
  * linguistics
  * rule based
* source language and target language

The mechanisms are shown below
* rule based
  * functionalism
    * constituency
  * formalism
    * rigor
    * precision
  * challenges
    * long distance dependency
    * syntactic ambiguity
* data-driven
  * EBMT: example based machine translation
  * SMT: statistical based machine translation
    * word based
      *  **IBM work on French-English translation, using the Canadian
 Hansards (1.7 million sentences of 30 words or less in length)**
      * expectation maximization
      * language model
      * translation model
      * conditional probability
    * phrase based
    * syntax based
      * parse tree/syntax rules
      * syntactic rules
  * NMT: neural machine translation
# *Telegraph* Morse Code and Global Connectivity
# *Typewriter* Mind and Style
# *Printing* Stability and Variability
# Language *Writing* and Literacy in Society
