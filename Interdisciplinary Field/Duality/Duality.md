# Why Duality an Intriguing Concept ?
Unlike other mathematic concepts, **Duality** is not defined rigorously alone, however, the concept of **Duality** appears in several seemingly unrelated fields. (Another example is the concept of *Linearity*) 

The connotations of **Duality** share common intrinsic characteristics while do not have an obvious definition.

To get a much clearer grip of **Duality**, I decide to collect its appearances that I have encountered.

# In Set Theory
* Two aspects of the world: whether take complementary formation or not.
  * $A^C$
  * $A$
* The dual items:
  * The union set, $\cup$
  * The intersection set, $\cap$
$$
(A \cup B)^C=A^C\cap B^C
$$
$$
(A\cap B)^C=A^C\cup B^C
$$
# In Electromagnetism
* Two aspects of the world: Electric and Magnetic.
* The dual items:

|One|Another|
|-|-|
|inductor|capacitor|
|current|voltage|
|magnetic flux|charge|


$$
C = \frac{dq}{dv}
$$
$$
L = \frac{d\psi}{di}
$$
$$
v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int dq=\frac{1}{C}\int i(t)dt
$$
$$
i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int d\psi=\frac{1}{L}\int v(t)dt
$$

# In Linear Algebra
The concept of:
* Vector Space and its Dual Space
* Linear Map and Dual Map
# In Analytic Geometry
The concept of:
* Pole and Polar
