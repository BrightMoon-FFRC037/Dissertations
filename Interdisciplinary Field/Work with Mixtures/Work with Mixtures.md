Once doing experiments, the real headache is to detect, separate and purify the mixtures. I want to comb through the method involved in those processes and find their common point and peculiarities. 

# In Chemistry
* Liquid Chromatography, separating by polarity
* Mass spectrometry, detecting mass and can not be used to separate on its own.
# In Biology
Contrary to chemical reactions, there exists reactions which produce purified products from purified reactants. **Thats is a profound reflection of the property of reproducing of life.** Monoclonal antibodies can be produced by a given protein, PRC can be performed to gets lots of copies of one given DNA segments, and cell lines can be constructed from a single targeting cell...Such kinds of reactions that are very rare in the field of chemistry are common in the field of Life Science.
## For Cells
* Isolating cells from tissues
  * proteolytic enzymes (trypsin and collagenase)
  * EDTA to chelate $Ca^{2+}$ ions.
* Primary Culture
* Secondary Culture (Passage)
* To Construct:
  * Normal Cell Lines
  * Transformed Cell Lines (proliferate everlasting)
## For DNAs
## For Proteins
* Monoclonal Antibodies (Produce Purified Proteins)
  * B Lymphocyte
  * transformed B lymphocyte cell lines
  * Hybridoma cell lines
*
